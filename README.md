# Hardwork-vs-Luck

An interesting and counter-intuitive experiment explained in this video: https://youtu.be/3LopI4YeC4I We take 1000 people and distribute them hardwork (0-100) randomly, luck (0-5) randomly and pick winner who has the highest hardwork+luck. Now, we calculate his hardwork percentile and luck percentile. We perform this experiment 10,000 times, and obtain the average hardwork and luck percentile.

I ran this program, and got a result that winner was more hardworking than 98.9% of people, where as he was also luckier than 80% of the people, even though the weightage of Luck was very less (0-5) whereas hardwork's weightage was much higher (0-100). This infers that Hardwork and Luck both plays important role in one's success.
